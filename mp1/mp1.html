      <h2 class = "space">OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        In this project, I created a Chrome extension called the "Cookie Counter". This extension functions to 
        increase awareness of a website's cookies - through replacing the images on a website with a cookie gif (based on how many cookies there are). The extension also has an option to delete the cookies 
        on the current page. 
        <br />

      <h2 class = "space">DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h2>
      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        These are the main steps I took in approaching this project.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = list>
        <li>Cloning examples from the instructor and reading/analyzing them to learn how javascript worked</li>
        <li>Found Google's cookie API, and narrowed down my project direction by using Google's cookie extension example as a starting point</li>
        <ul><li>Looking up readings for javascript, and how to connect html to it (did a lot of this throughout)</li></ul>
        <li>Laying out my files and customizing the CSS</li>
        <li>Created a line on my extension to display the current number of cookies</li>
        <ul><li>Having that number update once a user chooses to delete cookies</li></ul>
        <li>Created a "enable cookie" checkbox</li>
        <li>Connecting javascript to content script</li>
        <ul><li>Sending the number of cookies to content script once the checkbox is checked</li></ul>
        <li>(2 mid-process photos shown below)</li>

      <h2 class = "space">ISSUE DEEP DIVE</h2>
      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        I ran into several issues in this project. One of the most notable issues was displaying a line of text
        that updated the number of current cookies on a site. It was a logic issue where at first, I was unable to get the
        cookie number variable to be connected with my html's inline container.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = "list">
        <p>I approached this problem with several steps, including:</p>
        <li>Using console.log() to report back to see where in my code was coming up null</li>
        <li>Started by referencing the deleteCookies function that was originally in the template code</li>
        <ul><li>Created a getCookies() function to grab the cookies.length once the domain's cookies were gathered</li></ul>
        <ul><li>This function connected to another function of setCookie() which communicated that number back to the html inline container</li></ul>
        <li>My code was not working at this point, so I tried adding an EventListener that called a function when the DOM was fully loaded and parsed</li>
        <ul><li>This function would be able to grab the url and pass it in the earlier function I had made getCookies()</li></ul>
        <li>Lastly, I needed the extension to update this number whenever a user deleted the site's cookies</li>
        <ul><li>After failing to write a new function to do this, I instead went into the deleteCookies() function to set my cookies back to 0 once cookies were deleted</li></ul>

      <h2 class = "space">IDEAS AND FUTURE WORK</h2>
      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        Here are some ideas for improving on this extension:
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = "list">
        <li>Having the current number of cookies on the page float around on the screen</li>
        <li>Be able to update the number of cookies even after deleting them (as they come up)</li>
        <li>Have extra resource links about cookies</li>
        <li>Having original images come back up when the cookies are disabled</li>
        <li>Image of cookies update once they are deleted</li>
