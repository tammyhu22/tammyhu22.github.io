      <h2 class = "space">OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        I first approached my portfolio by constructing an idea of what it would look like in my head. I knew
        I wanted to stick to the dark mode theme since it was something new I hadn't tried. The overall steps
        I took were:
        <div class = list>
          <li>Creating a navigation bar with a "work" and "about" section, including my name in the top left corner</li>
          <li>Working on the landing page: editing the description to fit my personality</li>
          <ul><li>Creating a css hover interaction on the highlighted words that displayed images on hover</li></ul>
          <li>Putting in a bio under "about"</li>
          <li>Rearranging the front page to have a "projects" section, on top of an "extras" section</li>
          <ul><li>Including a cheatsheets page of helpful code under "extras"</li></ul>
          <ul><li>Adding titles under the picture containers</li></ul>
          <li>Changing all default fonts to custom fonts of IBM Plex Mono and DM Sans</li>
          <li>Putting in content on each page, and making sure everything was aligned correctly/organized legibly</li>
          <li>(A mid-process photo shown below)</li>
          <br />
            <div class = "picture-container2">
              <img
              class = "picture2"
              src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CJ6KXctRdx722jlGGb9gUk021kuBIxYoICmHAI-CrtLJPBKy19C_pXtjPUQnjkgwGs3YUHgkPhPQ7KU0o-X2imjEPoHnm1DVzXSFNEfuEOzGh5qNUPFx04qi8YeF9pCg7tLx0ZmKcg=w2400"
              width = "720px" height = "400px"
              />
            </div>
        </div>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class = "space">ISSUE(S)</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        I ran into a lot of issues in this process, including making this page - I struggled with figuring out how
        to indent lists, change line height of a list so it didn't look weird, adjusting the width of the text box,
        and adding an image that was scaled down but was aligned with the text. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class = "list">
          <p>One of the more notable issues I ran
          into was creating the navigation bar. I didn't know where to start, so I went on the internet looking for code
          I could utilize. But even when I copied in the code, my navigation bar didn't look right - the words were all 
          the wrong color and spacing. I did some research and figured out that the words on my nav bar were part of a list,
          in which I could adjust the margins. </p>
          <p>Editing the colors and fonts, I realized, were also done in a separate
          css element. On hover, the images would also overlap on top of the nav bar, a pretty big aesthetic issue. 
          I resolved this by adding z-index = 0 as a property of the nav bar.</p>
        </div>

      <h2 class = "space">CSS TRANSITION</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        The CSS transition I implemented was on my landing page: a hover effect on the highlighted words of
        my short intro. Essentially, I aimed to have a transition where if the cursor hovered over the words
        "sushi", "staring at cats", and "Single's Inferno", it would display a relevant image behind the words.
        <div class = list>I chose this CSS transition because I wanted to create a fun visual interaction as the first thing a 
        visitor on the site can play around with. I felt that it could show more personality than a plain description
        of myself. </div>
        <br />
        <p class = "intro-paragraph">How I made it work:</p>
        <div class = list>
          <li>Selected a color palette for the words I wanted to have a hover effect
            and added this individually to the html
          </li>
          <li>Created a new div class titled "hover-title", with the words
            nested inside. Created another div class called "hover-image" with the img link
          </li>
          <li>
            In the css file, I had the default hover-image to be hidden (visibility:hidden), so that when not hovered,
            the user can't see the image yet. I set a condition that when the hover-title is hovered,
            the hover-image because visible (visibility:visible)
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the properties of hover-image, I adjusted the position to be fixed, slightly
            offset from the hovered text, and appearing below the text. I had to consult the internet
            here for some help on specific syntax I should be using
          </li>
          <li>
            Scaled down the images to be consistent across the board
          </li>
          <br />
          <div class = "gif-container">
            <img
            class = "gif"
            src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/317KaNiw0seMPk9tPL/giphy.gif"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class = "space">IDEAS & FUTURE</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        These are some additional ideas for the site in the future:
        <br />
        <div class = "list">
          <li>Creating a hover interaction for project images</li>
          <li>Adding pill bottle tags for the projects as short phrase descriptions</li>
          <li>Adding a CSS transition for my top left logo, or some kind of animation</li>
          <li>Customizing my about page further</li>
