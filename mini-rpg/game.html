      <h2 class = "space">PLAN OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        My plan is to create a simple rpg environment based in javascript. The game would have a 
        pixel style character that can be controlled by keyboard input and some interactive NPCs 
        and short storyline if time allows. I have drawn sketches of the envisioned interface, which 
        is a coffee shop where the user plays as a barista. For the scope of this project, the game will 
        just take place in one environment.

        <h3 class = "space">PROTOTYPE VERSION</h3>
        <p class = "list">
            Will have a dev toolchain file set up with environment/character assets uploaded. 
            Character should be controlled by keyboard input and blocks/walls added into the game. 
            NPC and talking interaction as well.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 class = "space">FINAL VERSION</h3>
        <p class = "list">
            Building upon the prototype version, have some game interaction and/or storyline. 
            Then deploy it to a GitHub website.

        These are the main steps I will be taking in approaching this project.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class = list>
        1. Create personal pixel assets - probably use existing, free tilesets <br/>
        2. Create repository and set up file, following tutorial. Upload assets. <br/>
        3. Place in environment<br/>
        4. Add game objects<br/>
        5. Create grid-based movement and character animations<br/>
        6. Add camera movement<br/>
        7. Handle walls/collisions (Milestone 1 complete)<br/>
        8. Behaviors and cutscenes<br/>
        9. Typewriters/scenes<br/>
        10. Game behavior (serving customers)<br/>
        11. Add sound<br/>
        12. Title screen<br/>
        13. Deploy game (Milestone 2 complete)<br/>

      <!-- <h2 class = "space">ISSUE DEEP DIVE</h2>
      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        I ran into several issues in this project. One of the most notable issues was having different
        music playing at each stage of the game. This was a logic problem, as each song belonged to a different
        stage, and had to play at a different time depending on the user's actions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = "list">
        <p>I approached this problem with several steps, including:</p>
        <li>The audio was stacking on top of each other, so I created a boolean for each song to check if it was playing or not</li>
        <li>The music would only play in the correct stage if their corresponding boolean = false</li>
        <li>After looping through the game once, all music would stop playing</li>
        <ul><li>With the mousePressed function, I reset the booleans of the previous song back to false so when it loops back, the music will play again</li></ul>

        Here are some ideas for improving on this extension:

      <div class = "list">
        <li>Have "lives" for the players, signified by musubi on the screen</li>

        <li>Have different food themes/options for the player</li>
        <li>Add multiple musubi or other foods, add some "bad" items to avoid catching</li>
