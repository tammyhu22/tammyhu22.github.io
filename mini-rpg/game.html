      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        For my prototype, I’ve created a short version of my envisioned game. 
        There is no actual game story yet, but I have a clearer direction for it now that 
        I’ve laid out my file structure. This version consists of a beginning scene with 
        the (snarky) manager, where the user plays as a barista on their first day of work. 
        You can interact with the NPCs as well.

        These are the main steps I will be taking in approaching this project.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class = list>
        1. Creating my game assets with aseprite (purchased this program) <br/>
        2. Used some open source pixel assets from itch.io <br/>
        3. Using html canvas to draw my game area<br/>
        4. Add game objects<br/>
        5. Laying out a javascript world for my game: including separate javascript for each “object” in the game, like animation, people, text messages, etc. with their own properties<br/>
        6. OverworldMap.js builds out the map in layers, creating the effect that the player can walk behind objects <br/>
        7. Different “maps” are organized with several arrays, each with layers, gameObjects of characters, their position, image file, behavior loop, and talking sequences<br/>
        8. Adding player controls with EventListener<br/>
        9. Including a camera effect so the map centers around the character<br/>
        10. Incorporating “cutscenes”, scenes like talking where the player is unable to move and then NPCs behave a certain way<br/>
        11. Styling my text messages and animating the text writer effect<br/>
        12. Adding another EventListener for clicking enter to skip through dialogue<br/>
        13. Adding a title and instructions with customized font family<br/>
        14. Deploying to GitHub pages<br/>

        In testing out cutscenes where npcs and the player can move/not move
         based on a scripted scene, my code was running into a roadblock

        <p>I approached this problem with several steps, including:</p>
        <li>I wrote a few console.logs in my for loops and out, to see if the for loop was working</li>
        <li>When I saw that my index was pausing, I knew that the (assuming logic) issue was within my for loop so I then checked at which point it was stopping, which was at my player’s second movement going downward</li>
        <li>I realized that the player was running into a wall and the code was unable to continue because it didn’t know what to do if a player’s path has a block in it, so I simply adjusted the movement path</li>

      <div class = "list">
        <p>My scope has narrowed in terms of gameplay - at first I wasn’t sure what the 
          game was because I didn’t know how complicated it was to code this out. 
          Turns out, coding a game is quite time-consuming, so I’m trying to opt 
          for a simple matching game. I wanted to have multiple maps potentially, 
          but realized it would take a lot more time to implement that.</p>

      <h3 class = "space">TIME MANAGEMENT</h3>
      <div class = "list">
        <li>I spent a lot more time on the prototype than I imagined. In order 
          to try to complete my vision for the final submission, I sped up my 
          prototype timeline to allow for enough time to troubleshoot for my next plan 
          (since this starts to deviate a lot more from the tutorials, I’ll 
          have to rely on it less)</li>
        <li>I ran into issues with deploying through vite, and because my file 
          structure was not optimized/bundled for it, I have deployed it directly 
          to GitHub pages. This isn’t ideal, but was done for the sake of completing 
          the project on time.</li>

      <div class = "list">
        <p>I originally wanted a story-based narrative/gameplay on top of the main 
          functionality of serving customers. I’ve decided that it would focus 
          less on a storyline and more on interacting with different NPCs to make 
          a shorter game, in order to have better time management for the next week.</p>

      <h2 class = "space">PLAN OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        My plan is to create a simple rpg environment based in JavaScript. The game would have a 
        pixel style character that can be controlled by keyboard input and some interactive NPCs 
        and short storyline if time allows. I have drawn sketches of the envisioned interface, which 
        is a coffee shop where the user plays as a barista. For the scope of this project, the game will 
        just take place in one environment.

        I ran into several issues in this project. One of the most notable issues was having different
        music playing at each stage of the game. This was a logic problem, as each song belonged to a different
        stage, and had to play at a different time depending on the user's actions.

        <p>I approached this problem with several steps, including:</p>

        <li>The music would only play in the correct stage if their corresponding boolean = false</li>
        <li>After looping through the game once, all music would stop playing</li>
