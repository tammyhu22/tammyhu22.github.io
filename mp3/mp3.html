      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        In this project, I created a simple catching game with my illustrations. I used p5 and p5.play
        libraries to create the game interactions and mechanisms.

        These are the main steps I took in approaching this project.

      <br />
      <div class = list>
        <li>Set up development environment with npm</li>
        <li>Looked at tutorial code of p5.play library functions</li>
        <li>Laid out 3 stages/screens for the game: start, play, and game over</li>
        <li>Imported sound, images, and font</li>
        <ul><li>Editing sources to fit the dimensions of the game</li></ul>
        <li>Editing the catching mechanism to fit my illustration</li>

      <h2 class = "space">ISSUE DEEP DIVE</h2>
      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        I ran into several issues in this project. One of the most notable issues was having different
        music playing at each stage of the game. This was a logic problem, as each song belonged to a different
        stage, and had to play at a different time depending on the user's actions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = "list">
        <p>I approached this problem with several steps, including:</p>
        <li>The audio was stacking on top of each other, so I created a boolean for each song to check if it was playing or not</li>
        <li>The music would only play in the correct stage if their corresponding boolean = false</li>
        <li>After looping through the game once, all music would stop playing</li>
        <ul><li>With the mousePressed function, I reset the booleans of the previous song back to false so when it loops back, the music will play again</li></ul>

      <p class = "intro-paragraph">
        Here are some ideas for improving on this extension:
      </p>
      <br />
      <div class = "list">
        <li>Have "lives" for the players, signified by musubi on the screen</li>
        <li>Have a mute option for the game</li>
        <li>Have different food themes/options for the player</li>
        <li>Add multiple musubi or other foods, add some "bad" items to avoid catching</li>
